"""
There are a lot of directions we could take this

   - we could find the active frequency # and subtract 100*that value to get the raw topic #
   - we could add cursor functionality like in the chat
   - we could represent each seen topic in terms of percentage of recent traffic
   - we could put a timestamp on each topic to age out stale activity

I'm reasonably certain there's a way we can use the sequence number or the checksum in the message to help get the actual message count; what
I've exposed here is an estimate, at best.
