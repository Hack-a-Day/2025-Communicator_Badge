# Hardware Monitor

Multi-page system information display showing real-time badge hardware status.

## Controls

- **F1**: Previous page
- **F2**: Next page
- **Arrow Up/Down**: Scroll within page (if content exceeds screen)
- **F5**: Exit to menu

## Pages

1. **System** - CPU frequency, chip temperature, flash size, Python version, uptime
2. **Memory** - RAM usage, garbage collection stats, heap information
3. **Display** - Screen specs, backlight level, LVGL version
4. **LoRa** - Radio configuration, frequency, power, modulation parameters, signal stats
5. **I2C/GPIO** - Connected I2C devices, pin assignments
6. **Config** - Badge configuration values (alias, radio settings, etc.)

## Technical Details

- **Update Rate**: Refreshes every 1 second (20 iterations Ã— 50ms)
- **Max Visible Lines**: 9 lines per screen
- **Scrolling**: Automatic when page content exceeds display height
- **Memory**: Forces garbage collection before displaying memory stats

The monitor reads hardware state from various badge subsystems including the ESP32, LoRa radio (SX1262), display controller, and I2C buses. It displays a scroll indicator (e.g., "1-9/15") when content is scrollable.

### Memory Monitoring
The app runs `gc.collect()` before displaying memory statistics to ensure accurate reporting of available memory. This may cause memory usage to appear different when opening the monitor compared to normal operation.

### LoRa Signal Strength
The RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) shown on the LoRa page indicates the signal strength of the last received packet, measured in dBm. More negative values indicate weaker signals (e.g., -120 dBm is very weak, -40 dBm is strong).

### Customization
You can add custom monitoring pages by adding new page names to the `self.pages` list and creating corresponding `get_*_info()` methods that return lists of formatted strings.
